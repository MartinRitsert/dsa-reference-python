# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

## üéØ Purpose

This repository serves as my personal knowledge base and collection of Python implementations for common Data Structures and Algorithms (DS&A). It represents a consolidation of concepts I've studied and refined over time. The focus is on clear, understandable code that translates theoretical knowledge into working implementations.

## üìö What's Included

This collection currently includes implementations for:

* **1. Hash Tables** üóÇÔ∏è
    * `01a_HashTable_NoCollisionHandling.py`: A basic hash table implementation that **does not handle hash collisions**. This version is for illustrative purposes of basic hashing.
    * `01b_HashTable_SeparateChaining.py`: Hash table using separate chaining for collision resolution.
    * `01c_HashTable_LinearProbing.py`: Hash table using linear probing for collision resolution.
* **2. Linked Lists** üîó
    * `02a_LinkedList.py`: Singly linked list.
    * `02b_DoublyLinkedList.py`: Doubly linked list.
* **3. Stacks** üìö
    * `03_Stack.py`: Stack implementation (includes discussion/examples using both Python lists and `collections.deque`).
* **4. Queues** 
    * `04_Queue.py`: Queue implementation (includes discussion/examples using both Python lists and `collections.deque`).
* **5. Trees, Heaps & Tries** üå≥
    * `05a_Tree.py`: A general-purpose tree (N-ary tree).
    * `05b_BinarySearchTree.py`: Binary Search Tree (BST) with common operations including iterative traversals.
    * `05c_MinHeap.py`: Min-Heap implementation using an array.
    * `05d_MaxHeap.py`: Max-Heap implementation using an array.
    * `05e_Trie.py`: Trie (prefix tree) implementation.
* **6. Graphs** 
    * `06a_Graph.py`: Graph representations (adjacency list and adjacency matrix) with various algorithms like BFS/DFS for pathfinding, connectivity checks, and topological sort (Kahn's algorithm).
    * `06b_Dijkstra.py`: Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths (versions for adjacency list and adjacency matrix).
* **7. Searching Algorithms** üîç
    * `07_BinarySearch.py`: Binary Search (iterative and recursive versions).
* **8. Sorting Algorithms** üî¢
    * `08a_SelectionSort.py`: Selection Sort.
    * `08b_BubbleSort.py`: Bubble Sort (with optimization).
    * `08c_InsertionSort.py`: Insertion Sort.
    * `08d_ShellSort.py`: Shell Sort.
    * `08e_MergeSort.py`: Merge Sort.
    * `08f_QuickSort.py`: Quick Sort (Lomuto and Hoare partition scheme).
* **9. Disjoint Set**
    * `09_UnionFind.py`: Union-Find data structure with path compression and union by rank optimizations.
* **10. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithms**
    * `10_Kruskal_And_Prim.py`: Implementations of Kruskal's algorithm (typically for sparse graphs), Prim's algorithm using an adjacency matrix (suitable for dense graphs), and Prim's algorithm using an adjacency list (suitable for sparse graphs).

*(The file naming convention `01a, 01b, ...` is used to group related concepts or show a progression of implementations, though some names have been made more descriptive.)*

## üí° My Approach

The implementations in this collection reflect an ongoing effort to:
* Solidify understanding of the core logic and intricacies of each data structure and algorithm.
* Explore and document different implementation strategies and their trade-offs (e.g., various hash table collision resolution techniques, different backends for stacks/queues)
* Maintain clear, understandable, and well-commented Python code that serves as a reliable personal reference.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing Status & Disclaimer

**Important:** While the core logic of these implementations has been developed and tested with basic examples (often found within `if __name__ == '__main__':` blocks in the respective files), this collection **does not currently include a comprehensive suite of formal unit tests.**

These implementations are intended for **educational, illustrative, and personal reference purposes only**. They should not be considered production-ready or used in critical applications without further rigorous testing and potential refinement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites 

* This collection requires **Python 3.9 or newer** due to the use of modern type hinting features (e.g., `list[int]` instead of `typing.List[int]`).

## üöÄ How to Use

Most files contain an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block with example usage. You can typically run these Python files directly to see a basic demonstration of the data structure or algorithm in action.
